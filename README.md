Welcome to the repository for the `AntNupTracker` app. A contribution guide is coming shortly. The code is designed to try to follow Dart and Flutter style.

This app is a tool for browsing records of [ant nuptial flights](https://www.antnuptialflights.com/about/) and reporting new flights from the field. Visit our website at https://www.antnuptialflights.com for more details. For the server-side application that manages the database of ant nuptial flights, please go to [this repository](https://github.com/bzrudski/antnuptracker-server/).

(All source files say GPL, but the App Store Exception is applied to all files in this project in order to not defeat the purpose of this project.)

In order to build, clone this repository and open it in an IDE. You may need to tweak a few settings. If you would like to test your modifications against a custom version of the backend, make sure that you change the `base` argument value in `url_manager.dart`.
